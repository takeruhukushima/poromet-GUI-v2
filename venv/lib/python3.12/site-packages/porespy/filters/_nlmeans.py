def nl_means_layered(im, cores=None, axis=0, patch_size=5, patch_distance=5, h=4):
    r"""
    Apply the non-local means filter to each 2D layer of a stack in parallel.

    This applies ``skimage.restoration.denoise_nl_means`` to each slice, so
    refer to the documentation of that function for further information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        The greyscale image with noise to be removed
    cores : int (optional)
        The number of cores to use for the processing. By default all
        available cores are used.
    axis : int
        The axis along which slices should be taken. This should
        correspond to the axis of rotation of the tomography stage, so if
        the sample was rotated about the z-axis, then use ``axis=2``.
    patch_size : int
        Size of patches used for denoising
    patch_distance : int
        Maximal distance in pixels where to search patches used for
        denoising.
    h : float
        Cut-off distance (in gray levels). The higher ``h``, the more
        permissive one is in accepting patches. A higher h results in a
        smoother image, at the expense of blurring features. For a
        Gaussian noise of standard deviation sigma, a rule of thumb is to
        choose the value of ``h`` to be sigma of slightly less.

    Notes
    -----
    The quality of the result depends on ``patch_size``,
    ``patch_distance``, ``h``, and ``sigma``.  It is recommended to
    experiment with a single slice first until a suitable set of
    parameters is found.

    Each slice in the stack is adjusted to have the same histogram and
    intensity.
