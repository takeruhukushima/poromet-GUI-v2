def drainage(im, voxel_size, pc=None, inlets=None, outlets=None, residual=None,

    r"""
    Simulate drainage using image-based sphere insertion, optionally including
    gravity

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        The image of the porous media with ``True`` values indicating the
        void space.
    voxel_size : float
        The resolution of the image in meters per voxel edge.
    pc : ndarray, optional
        An array containing precomputed capillary pressure values in each
        voxel. If not provided then the Washburn equation is used with the
        provided values of ``sigma`` and ``theta``. If the image is 2D only
        1 principle radii of curvature is included.
    inlets : ndarray (default = x0)
        A boolean image the same shape as ``im``, with ``True`` values
        indicating the inlet locations. See Notes. If not specified it is
        assumed that the invading phase enters from the bottom (x=0).
    outlets : ndarray, optional
        Similar to ``inlets`` except defining the outlets. This image is used
        to assess trapping.  \If not provided then trapping is ignored,
        otherwise a mask indicating which voxels were trapped is included
        amoung the returned data.
    residual : ndarray, optional
        A boolean array indicating the locations of any residual defending
        phase. This is added to the intermediate image prior to trimming
        disconnected clusters, so will create connections to some clusters
        that would otherwise be removed. The residual phase is indicated
        in the final image by ``-np.inf`` values, since there are invaded at
        all applied capillary pressures.
    bins : int or array_like (default = 25)
        The range of pressures to apply. If an integer is given
        then bins will be created between the lowest and highest pressures
        in the ``pc``.  If a list is given, each value in the list is used
        directly in order.
    delta_rho : float (default = 997)
        The density difference between the invading and defending phases.
        Note that if air is displacing water this value should be -997 (1-998).
    g : float (default = 9.81)
        The gravitational constant prevailing for the simulation. The default
        is 9.81. If the domain is on an angle, such as a tilted micromodel,
        this value should be scaled appropriately by the user
        (i.e. g = 9.81 sin(alpha) where alpha is the angle relative to the
        horizonal).  Setting this value to zeor removes any gravity effects.
    sigma : float (default = 0.072)
        The surface tension of the fluid pair. If ``pc`` is provided this is
        ignored.
    theta : float (defaut = 180)
        The contact angle of the sytem in degrees.  If ``pc`` is provded this
        is ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    results : Results object
        A dataclass-like object with the following attributes:

        ========== ============================================================
        Attribute  Description
        ========== ============================================================
        im_pc      A numpy array with each voxel value indicating the
                   capillary pressure at which it was invaded
        im_satn    A numpy array with each voxel value indicating the global
                   saturation value at the point it was invaded
        pc         1D array of capillary pressure values that were applied
        swnp       1D array of non-wetting phase saturations for each applied
                   value of capillary pressure (``pc``).
        ========== ============================================================

    Notes
    -----
    - The direction of gravity is always towards the x=0 axis
    - This algorithm has only been tested for gravity stabilized
      configurations, meaning the more dense fluid is on the bottom.
      Be sure that ``inlets`` are specified accordingly.
